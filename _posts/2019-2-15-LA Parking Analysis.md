title: Side Project - Analyzing All Los Angeles Parking Violations from 2018
---

With a bit of free time this weekend, I decided to do some hobby coding in Python, which I've presented <a href="https://stevebottos.github.io/jupnotes/LA Parking Violations 2018" target="_blank">here as a Jupyter Notebook</a>. The point of this side project is to create a map of LA according to parking tickets received from last year (2018) and to produce some helpful visualizations. I want to start with the full dataset (~9-million x 19, saved as a .csv > 1gb) to gain more experience handling large .csv files that are cumbersome to work with in excel and are slow to work with in Python unless processed in batches (especially when you don't have much RAM available). 
> **Key Concepts**: Python (Numpy/Matplotlib/Pandas/Folium(Mapping Package)), Jupyter Notebooks, Data Science, Big Data
