title: Cognitive Context Detection With Matlab
---

In a previous project, I demonstrated how to implement a Neural Network from start to finish using only home-made functions written in Matlab. I've finally uploaded [an identical Neural Network, but written with Python](https://github.com/stevebottos/PYTHON-Cognitive-State-Detection). This is just the Neural Network itself for comparison, and it does not include any of the pre-processing steps that the Matlab code base showcases. Data which was already prepared is included in the repository. For a full ReadMe describing the original use of the code, and its applications, check the <a href="https://github.com/stevebottos/MATLAB-Cognitive-State-Detection" target="_blank">original Matlab repository</a>
> **Key Concepts**: Python (Numpy/Scipy/Matplotlib/Pandas), Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Data Science
