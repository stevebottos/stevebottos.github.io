title: Hidden Markov Model Tutorial

Hidden Markov Models are powerful tools, commonly used in a wide range of applications from stock price
prediction, to gene decoding, to speech recognition.<a href = "https://github.com/stevebottos/stevebottos.github.io/blob/master/_downloads/HMM_Tutorial.pdf" target = "_blank"> This is a tutorial</a> on Hidden Markov Models that I wrote, and thought to would make publicly available for download since I believe it captures the intuition quite well. 
> **Key Concepts**: Hidden Markov Models, Machine Learning, Tutorials, Statistical Analysis
