A webcam eye tracker, currently a work in progress, which is intended to perform comparably to more expensive hardware/software for a mere fraction of the price. This began as an experimental side project that was to be tested during my graduate research, however at some point other research endeavors took priority. The end goal was to obtain map an individual's eye-gaze points to (x,y)-coordinates on a plane - ie: the computer screen. In its current state, the program functions as an accurate iris localization tool. The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/stevebottos/eye-tracker" target="_blank">here</a>.
> **Key Concepts**: Python (dlib, OpenCV), Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Real-Time Image Processing
