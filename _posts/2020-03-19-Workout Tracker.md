After seeing the "pushup challenge" videos taking social media by storm, I decided to collaborate and develop something fun and useful for everyone while the gyms are closed and we're all relying on good old fashioned body weight exercises.

Using a custom, built-from-scratch CNN trained on a dataset that the two of us personally curated and annotated, we have built a tool that will act as your "virtual spotter" and count your pushups as you complete them in front of a webcam. I may decide to continue developing this, a few future ideas include:
- Make this work on a smartphone
- Develop an "alarm clock" app that won't shut off until a set number of pushups are completed
- Of course, expand to new exercises like burpees and crunches
