title: Cognitive Context Detection With Tensorflow
---

In previous projects, I demonstrated how to implement a Neural Network from start to finish using only home-made functions written in both Matlab and Python. I've uploaded [a Tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/stevebottos/TENSORFLOW-Cognitive-State-Detection) for the sake of comparison (note that this was written pre-Keras, Tensorflow code can now be written much more intuitively using Keras wrappers). I've concluded that Tensorflow offers increased productivity in the form of quicker-to-write code and faster training times. The optimization functions that TF offers are great, and allowed me to train my models in a fraction of the time that Matlab or Python+Numpy in conjunction with the GPU acceleration capabilities. Comparing the two files MatlabResults in the [Matlab Implementation](https://github.com/stevebottos/Matlab-Cognitive-State-Detection) and TensorflowResults in this repo demonstrate the notable accuracy improvements that Tensorflow offers as well.
