<a href="https://stevebottos.github.io/jupnotes/GazeTrackerWriteup/" target="_blank">Here </a>you'll find a Jupyter Notebooks writeup detailing Version 1 of the Gaze Tracking System. The Gaze Tracking System designed to determine which line of text that an individual is currently reading given absolutely no prior knowledge of the page layout or what is being displayed on the screen whatsoever. Currently, the algorihm is able to detect when a reader progresses from one line to the next down the page, beginning from the top, and is able to accurately pinpoint in real time when this change of lines takes place. Given noisy data, the system performs well, and is able to accurately construct the layout of the page in terms of lines of text on the page in real time.

> **Key Concepts**: Machine Learning, Python (Numpy, Pomegranate), Bayesian Statistics, Hidden Markov Models
