<a href="https://github.com/stevebottos/cpp_tutorials" target="_blank">This repository </a>contains a collection of C++ tutorials that I put together for a class of junior electrical engineering students. They're designed to be short, simple, and accessible to complete beginners. I've been getting good feedback from the students, so I thought that I would share the tutorials with whoever may be interested in them.

> **Key Concepts**: C++, C, Coding, Tutorials
