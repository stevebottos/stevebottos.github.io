title: Side Project - Webcam Eye Tracker
---

A webcam eye tracker, a work in progress. Intended to perform comparably to more expensive hardware/software for a mere fraction of the price. This began as an experimental project that was to be used during my grad research, however at some point other endeavors took priority. There is much improvement to be done here, first some kind of smoothing/estimation algorithm should be put to work so that the iris detection isn't so jittery/inconsistent, I know that the Kalman filter would be a good candidate. Next, the pupul should be extracted from the iris and drawn as a point. Finally, the pupil location should be mapped to (x,y) coordinates on a plane - ie: the computer screen.

With a bit of free time this weekend, I decided to do some hobby coding in Python, which I've presented <a href="https://stevebottos.github.io/jupnotes/LA Parking Violations 2018" target="_blank">here as a Jupyter Notebook</a>. The point of this side project is to create a map of LA according to parking tickets received from last year (2018) and to produce some helpful visualizations. I want to start with the full dataset (~9-million x 19, saved as a .csv > 1gb) to gain more experience handling large .csv files that are cumbersome to work with in excel and are slow to work with in Python unless processed in batches (especially when you don't have much RAM available).
